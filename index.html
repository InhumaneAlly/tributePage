            Elliot Alderson, a notorious cyberpunk who's caught the wind of
            Federal Bureau of Investigation for illegally hacking into the
            systems of the Government of United States for clearing pending
            debts for the all the citizens under the burden of E-Corp, a
            multinational corporation perceived as 'Evil' corp among the
            memebers of fsociety. Fsociety, initially forged and crafted by
            Elliot himself is first seen to be the masterpiece of his late
            father who happens to be only visible to Elliot from time to time
            due to the former's condition in psychological well-being. A loner,
            a high functioning introvert with mood swings and inexplicable
            disorders only limited by the imagination of the narrator which is
            Elliot himself.

        <h1>Personlaity Traits of Mr.Alderson</h1>
        <h3>
          Paranoid, anxious, angry, delusional, depressed, and intelligent. No
          one else in fsociety can hack like Elliot, but the battles being waged
          in his head often get in the way of his work. He avoids eye contact
          and the touch of even close friends. Elliot goes to mandatory
          counseling, but he doesnâ€™t take it very seriously; he worries that
          going on medication could numb him and make him just like everyone
          else, sleepwalking through their days and doing nothing to fight back
          against Evil Corp. Unable to battle with his outburst of emotions from
          time to time, he sulks himself in a corner whenever the loner's mood
          hits him hard.
